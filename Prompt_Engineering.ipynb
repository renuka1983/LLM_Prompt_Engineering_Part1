Action and Reaction Pairs:**\n","   - Provide examples and ask students to identify the action and reaction force pairs in each scenario. Examples could include:\n","     - A person pushing against a wall.\n","     - A ball bouncing off the ground.\n","     - A swimmer pushing against the water.\n","   - Encourage students to think about the forces involved and how they act on different objects.\n","\n","**3. Real-Life Applications:**\n","   - Discuss real-life examples where Newton's Third Law is at play, such as:\n","     - Rocket propulsion: The action force is the expulsion of gas from the rocket engines, and the reaction force is the resulting upward movement of the rocket.\n","     - Walking: Each step involves pushing against the ground, which pushes back with an equal force, propelling the person forward.\n","     - Driving a car: The tires push against the road, and the road pushes back, propelling the car forward.\n","   - Encourage students to brainstorm other examples they encounter in daily life.\n","   \n","**Conclusion:**\n","Review the key points of the lesson:\n","- Newton's Third Law states that for every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction.\n","- Action and reaction force pairs exist in all interactions between objects.\n","- Understanding Newton's Third Law helps us explain and predict motion in the world around us.\n","\n","**Assessment:**\n","Conduct a short quiz or discussion to assess students' understanding of Newton's Third Law and their ability to identify action and reaction force pairs in different scenarios. Encourage students to ask questions if they need further clarification.\n","\n","**Extension:**\n","Challenge students to research and present on advanced applications of Newton's Third Law, such as in sports, engineering, or space exploration. This can deepen their understanding and appreciation of the concept."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"R46hb_Rnp-Xi"},"source":["\n","\n","---\n","\n","\n","This is good foundational material but this alone doesn't provide great learning experience.

Rather than immediately providing an answer, this approach encourages the model to approach the problem by breaking it down into simpler sub-problems. By doing so, it is more probable that the model will find answers to these sub-problems within its training data, thereby increasing the likelihood of accurate responses. Subsequently, the model can build upon the solutions obtained from these sub-problems to address the entire problem effectively."]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"gXS-onI2MJDu"},"outputs":[],"source":["quiz_input = \"\"\"Task: Generate a mcq quiz on the teaching material mentioned above.\n","\n","\n","Output Format:\n","Use the following format for each question:\n","\n","Question: [QUESTION TEXT]\n","Options:\n","a) [OPTION A]\n","b) [OPTION B]\n","c) [OPTION C]\n","d) [OPTION D]\n","\n","Explanation:\n","[EXPLANATION FOR CORRECT ANSWER]\n","\n","Correct Option: [Correct Option]\n","\n","Incorrect Answers:\n","a) [EXPLANATION FOR OPTION A BEING CORRECT/INCORRECT]\n","b) [EXPLANATION FOR OPTION B BEING CORRECT/INCORRECT]\n","c) [EXPLANATION FOR OPTION C BEING CORRECT/INCORRECT]\n","d) [EXPLANATION FOR OPTION D BEING CORRECT/INCORRECT]\n","\n","\"\"\""]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"vgXkkKG5MJEO"},"outputs":[],"source":["user_input = \"\"\"\n","**Lesson Material:**\n","\n","solving two-step equations\"\"\""]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"TPxKygtWMJEO"},"outputs":[],"source":["messages = [{\"role\":\"user\",\"content\":user_input+quiz_input}]"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"bx6-Kj-cMJEO"},"outputs":[],"source":["response = client.chat.completions.create(\n","    messages = messages,\n","    model = CHATGPT_MODEL,\n","    temperature=0,\n","    top_p = 0.2\n",")"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"Mrjqew5XMJEO","outputId":"7da277a8-0643-4108-af3e-6936fe2eabac"},"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["Question: What is the first step in solving a two-step equation?\n","Options:\n","a) Add or subtract the constant term\n","b) Multiply or divide the variable term\n","c) Combine like terms\n","d) None of the above\n","\n","Explanation: The first step in solving a two-step equation is to undo the addition or subtraction by performing the opposite operation.\n","\n","Correct Option: a\n","\n","Incorrect Answers:\n","b) Multiplying or dividing the variable term is the second step in solving a two-step equation.\n","c) Combining like terms is not necessary in solving a two-step equation.\n","d) None of the above is incorrect as there is a specific first step in solving a two-step equation.\n","\n","Question: Solve for x: 3x + 5 = 14\n","Options:\n","a) x = 3\n","b) x = 4\n","c) x = 9\n","d) x = 11\n","\n","Explanation: The first step is to undo the addition by subtracting 5 from both sides.
